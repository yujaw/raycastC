# RayCast

A simple ray casting engine implemented in C using OpenGL. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of 2D ray casting, often used in early 3D games and visualization tools.

## Features

- 2D ray casting algorithm
- Basic rendering of walls
- Configurable map layout
- Real-time user controls

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GLAD, GLFW

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yujaw/RayCast.git
cd RayCast
```

### Running

```bash
make
```

## Usage

- Use WASD to move around the environment.
- Observe how rays interact with walls to create a pseudo-3D effect.
