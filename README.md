# RayCast 🚀

A simple ray casting engine implemented in C using OpenGL. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of 2D ray casting, often used in early 3D games and visualization tools. 🎮

## Features ✨

- 2D ray casting algorithm 🔦
- Basic rendering of walls 🧱
- Configurable map layout 🗺️
- Real-time user controls ⌨️

## Getting Started 🏁

### Prerequisites 📦

- GLAD, GLFW

### Installation 🛠️

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yujaw/RayCast.git
cd RayCast
```

### Running ▶️
